<h4>What is the problem that you will be investigating? Why is it interesting?</h4>
<p>
  For this project, we will be investigating the relationship between the attributes of passengers and their likelihood of survival during a disaster. We found this  topic to be interesting because it provides insight on how personal characteristics can affect an individual's resilience
</p>
<h4>What reading will you examine to provide context and background?</h4>
<p>
  These are the articles we are referencing for our project:
  <ul>
    <li>https://www.history.com/topics/early-20th-century-us/titanic  </li>
    <li>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8229835?casa_token=1F3wQQh2tm8AAAAA:n3eLpYnlybpr98XuxAKF10wSoUOLgshk0m86a2FCkbCjMjZUKrbBI8cmt2we3wXTBswzHvUgqwo

 </li>
    <li>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3348839?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents</li>
    </ul>

   We decided to use these sources because we think that they will be helpful to prioritize the factors that are needed for our model. In general we want to only have factors/characteristics that will only have a big impact on our data.

<h4>What data will you use? If you are collecting new data, how will you do it?</h4>
<p>
   The data we will be using is provided from kaggle. The dataset includes passenger information which consists of; name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

</p>
<h4>What method or algorithm are you proposing? If there are existing implementations, will you use them and how? How do you plan to improve or modify such implementations? You donâ€™t have to have an exact answer at this point, but you should have a general sense of how you will approach the problem you are working on.</h4>
<p>
  We plan on applying a logistic regression to multiple different characteristics of passengers. By doing this, we can find the relationship between probability of death and multiple different attributes such as age, gender, and social status. There are other implementations of our planned algorithm which we currently plan to improve upon using different visualization methods. This will allow us to view the data in a different context and make new comparisons.
</p>
<h4>How will you evaluate your results? Qualitatively, what kind of results do you expect (e.g. plots or figures)? Quantitatively, what kind of analysis will you use to evaluate and/or compare your results (e.g. what performance metrics or statistical tests)?</h4>
<p>
  We plan to evaluate our data by determining the statistical probability that a passenger dies based on a given characteristic. We will then provide a logistic regression graph to visualize the result. Then, we will apply our algorithm to a test data set and observe how similar our results are to the actual result of the disaster.
